<p>Do you want to play the pass line or don't pass line?</p>
<p>In craps, there are several bets you can make. The most common ones for beginners are the "Pass Line" and "Don't Pass" bets.<p>

<p>Pass Line: This bet is made before the initial roll (come-out roll). If the result is 7 or 11, you win. If it's 2, 3, or 12, you lose. Any other number becomes the "point," and the game continues.<p>
<p>Don't Pass: This is the opposite of Pass Line. If the result is 2 or 3, you win. If it's 7 or 11, you lose. If it's 12, it's a push (tie), and you get your bet back. Any other number becomes the "point," and the game continues.<p>

<%= form_tag do %>
  <%= radio_button_tag :bet_type, 'pass_line', true %> Pass Line
  <%= radio_button_tag :bet_type, 'dont_pass_line' %> Don't Pass Line
  <%= submit_tag 'Start Rolling' %>
<% end %>

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const form = document.querySelector('form');
    form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      const betType = document.querySelector('input[name="bet_type"]:checked').value;
      if (betType === 'pass_line') {
        window.location.href = '/pass_line';
      } else {
        window.location.href = '/dont_pass_line';
      }
